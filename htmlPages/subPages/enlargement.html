        <p id="subtitleText">This was an assignment from the KABK where we had to bring in an A4 image of anyone (I picked the late King Joffrey) and
            enlarge that image to A1 any way we want. Then we had to pick a quote, which was to give people a clue as to who the person was - as some
            became unrecognisable - not really applicable to me as I have the A4 image in my A1. Anyway, I used a flash light on a cutout of Joffrey
            to make his shadow elongate against the wall then took a photo, I originally cut Joffrey and my landlords hand out but then decided
            how weird and cool I found it.
            <br><br>Made in 2014.
