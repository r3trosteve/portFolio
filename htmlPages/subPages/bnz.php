        <p id="subtitleText">My summer internship at BNZ was awesome and I updated the code on the open and account page so that
            an eftpos card was not an option for the user, as they were phasing them out. Other changes involved the google
            pay/apple pay bullet point. It was done with the JavaScript library React, I also was involved with the design.
