        <p id="subtitleText">This was my very first interaction with coding, it was a very brief one while I was enrolled at the KABK.
            It was a group project done with Carina Stella and Suzanne Westland, our assignment was to manipulate text using code. We
            settled on making certain words trigger a change in imagery or font or sometimes both that would appear in a subtitled video.
            The change in the styling would be linked to the word it was affected by, for example, the word "good" would make facebook
            thumbs up appear on the screen, or the word "dies" would result in the font being bold and shattered. The code works with
            any video with a subtitles file, but we presented the one on the left as it had a good array of different words that would
            set off many of the changes.
