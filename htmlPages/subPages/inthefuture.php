        <p id="subtitleText">This is a poster about the future and the uncertainty of the lifespan of the Earth, I try to include the
            reference to global warming with the 2 sides being different temperatures. The confusing  over the top, each line
            contradicting the next meaning we don't really know what's going to happen and even if global warming is an issue, we'll
            probably run out of food and water pretty soon and die out that way. The words are actually a David Byrne song,
            unfortunately the song wasn't long enough for the font I wanted to use, so I made the last few lines, so sorry David.
