        <p id="subtitleText">This was an assignment I did to get into Willem De Kooning in Rotterdam, Holland. We had to make a pamphlet
            on anything we wanted, this was the first one I ever made. I decided to make one for the gym I was working at part-time, Skilltown
            in Hackney (obviously I never showed it to them). So one time I subtley took pictures of people doing flips and breakdancing
            on my phone with an inexcusably bad camera (I also use an inexcusably font). I really liked making it and had fun doing it but
            can tell this was before I studied design. There are two versions, I can't even remember which I picked to get into the university.
            <br><br>Made in 2014.
