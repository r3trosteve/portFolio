        <p id="subtitleText">This was a uni assignment from the KABK in the Netherlands that students were asked to do after we returned
            from BRNO, the Czech Republic and the big annual graphic design festival there. The assignment was to imagine we picked the theme
            for next year's festival and then make silkscreened posters for advertising it. The font was done by me and was inspired by one seen
            at the festival, a requirement for the assignment. As I picked 'crafting' as my theme, which is making things by hand, I picked
            this one for my final poster, which was an early test print as the mistakes in it correlated with my theme.
