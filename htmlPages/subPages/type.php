        <p id="subtitleText">This was done in typography class in the Netherlands, we had to get checked paper and then make our
            own type design using only squares and triangles, then we would trace over them to curve the edges. I picked the
            letter 'r' to make into a final. The final is riso-printed after making many adjustments. The process is also
            shown, along with the 'r' computerised half way through the adjustments, which were done digitally in illustrator.
            <br><br>Made in 2015.
